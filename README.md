# OnePage Template

A small demo template to realize a "one pager" with TYPO3.

This is only a basic implementation and it's missing some features.

## Setup

1. Install and activate extension
2. Include the static template from fluid_styled_content
3. Include the static template of this extension

It only needs a basic site structure:
